## Project description
The objective of this project is to assist in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients by classifying the level of dementia they have using MRI images. This is a classification problem and a machine learning model, which utilized neural networks was developed as the solution. The model was trained and tested using a very large dataset of MRI images found on Kaggle. The dataset consists of about 6400 total images. These images were also sorted into four classes of interest: No Dementia, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia. The dataset of images for each class was also further split into training and testing groups in a 80:20 ratio, respectively. The model was trained until achieving a loss of 0.00 and testing the model resulted in an accuracy of 100%. The applications of this project could be in assisting physicians to assess the severity of dementia quickly and accurately in their Alzheimerâ€™s patients. This type of method is especially important as it can make a large impact on the course of action that the physician takes for their patient.
