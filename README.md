## Project description
The main goal of this project is to determine which cells are living versus dead in images under microscopes. The primary application of this program would be to quickly determine cell viability after collecting a sample. We plan on using the “Cell-Dataset” from GitHub, which contains 2500 images of living and dead cells.After the model becomes fully trained, there will be no need to manually count alive and dead cells strenuously through a microscope, and instead the process can be done reliably and efficiently.
